<body><h1>The Complete History of "The Chronic Bitch Face"</h1>
    <h4> As told by <i>Alina Itkin</i></h4>
    
 <h3> The Birth </h3>  
<p>The day was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_25">February 25th, 1988</a>. Many would tell you it was a regular day like any other - the winds didn't suddenly shift to cause a great storm, no tsunamis hit main lands, and locusts didn't descend on the population. Everything was particularly normal by every standard of the word. Yet, in a little hospital in the Soviet Union lay a woman by the name of Rita. She had been expecting a little boy to come and join her family of three and complete their communist circle. Yet, that morning, at exactly 11:35am - a very special girl came into the world. </p>

    <p>As the little girl emerged into the world, the hospital rang with the joy of a newborn. There were tears and smiles and hugs all around. She was healthy - albeit a little overweight at 8lbs.</p>
